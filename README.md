arxiv.sh :  daily query for new arXiv articles in select topics via RSS

Update (2023-06-29): My old script was too buggy (brittle due to upstream changes that occassionally occur on the arXiv site), so I completely rewrote it.

I schedule the script to run daily (/etc/crontab) and mail the results to myself, which I read in Claws Mail (screenshot attached).
